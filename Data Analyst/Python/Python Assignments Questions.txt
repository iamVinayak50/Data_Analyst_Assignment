5. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included)

6. Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.

Note : Use 'continue' statement.

Expected Output : 0 1 2 4 5

7. Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50.

Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....

Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

Expected Output : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

8. Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50.

Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....

Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

Expected Output : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
